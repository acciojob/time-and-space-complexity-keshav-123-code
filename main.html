<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. An efficient algorithm is one that minimizes the time complexity, ensuring quicker execution as the input size grows.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) requires memory proportional to the input size. This is important for optimizing memory usage in software applications.</p>
